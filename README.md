# VideoWatchers

## A scalable and efficient Web application that allows multiple users to concurrently retrieve and view videos in real-time, providing an engaging and seamless video streaming experience. 


### Getting started
In this project, we utilize Docker to containerize the various services. If you do not have Docker installed on your system, please follow the instructions provided at this link: https://docs.docker.com/get-started/

Once Docker is successfully installed, navigate to the project directory and execute the following command:
docker-compose up

This will launch all the containerized services specified in the docker-compose.yml file, allowing you to run the entire application stack within a secure and isolated environment.
